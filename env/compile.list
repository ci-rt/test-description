# List of kernel configurations that should be built
#
# It is possible to list user defined kernel configurations as well as
# predefined kernel defconfigs. The naming convention is as followed:
#
# 	     ARCH/CONFIG_NAME
#
# If there exists a file "CONFIG_NAME" in compile/config/ARCH/, this
# configuration is used. If not, the Linux kernel source code is
# scanned for the configuration in arch/ARCH/configs/

# ARCH=x86
x86/qemu_x86_64
