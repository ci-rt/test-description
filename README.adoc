CI-RT Test-description
======================

The used git repository structure to define a CI-RT test run is
explained in the following.

Every branch defines an own test. The structure stays the same. The
given example executes the following tests:

- (cross) compile kernel with arm phyflex-imx6, x86 x86_64_defconfig
  and x86 x86_64def_e1000e configuration in each case as it is and
  with RT-full overlay

- boottest on phyflex-imx6 (phyflex-imx6 config with RT-full overlay)
  and on iommu (x86_64def_e1000e config with RT-full overlay).

- cyclictest on iommu without load


(directories are marked with +-).

----
+-env			  (environment settings)
	global.properties (definition of global environment settings)
	compile.list	  (list of all compile tests, that should be executed)
	overlay.list	  (list of overlays, that should be used for compile
			   tests)
	boottest.list	  (list of all boottests)
	email.list	  (list of notification email addresses)

+-compile		  (configurations and overlays for compile test as well as
			   compile properties files)
	+-configs	  (user defined kernel configurations, in subdirectories
			   sorted by architecture)
		+-arm	  (all arm configurations)
		+-x86	  (all x86 configurations)
	+-overlays	  (folder with all defined overlays; overlays define
			   additional kernel configs)
	compile.properties(general compile properties)
	arm		  (architecture dependent (cross) compile properties)

+-boot			  (boottest settings, each boottest has an own file)

+-cyclictest		  (cyclictest settings)
	iommu.list	  (list with all cyclictests for a target such as iommu)
	idle		  (environment setting for a specific cyclictest)

The structure of the files is explained more detailed in the files
itself. The kernel configuration files and the overlay files abide by
the rules of Linux kernel configuration files. No further explanation
is given.
